## This the *Ethics in NLP* reading circle at Brandeis.  
The Ethics in Natural Language Processing (NLP) reading circle is a graduate student led reading group housed in the Department of Computer Science at Brandeis University. While the group is centered around the computational linguistics community at Brandeis, anyone interested in the topic is welcome to join us!

PDFs for all readings are accesible in the [readings repository](https://github.com/ethicsatbrandeis/readings) on our GitHub.

## Previous Meetings
### NLP and Fake News Detection, April 21st, 2020

Progress in natural language generation has raised concerns regarding their use in harmful applications, like the generatation of neural fake news. How can we apply the approach of threat modeling to recent NLP techologies in terms of their applicability and perpencity towards harm? What approaches can we use to identify fake news and other misuses of NLP technology? 

#### Readings

Defending Against Neural Fake News, Zellers et al - <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12616>


### Psychology of Technology, April 7th, 2020

Some opens questions concerning technology: a hammer can be said to be the cause of nailing, but it is also true that the end of building a house is even moreso the cause of nailing. What ends cause our interactions with technology, and what ends cause organizations like Google's interactions with technology? Material wealth comes to mind as an answer, but what kind of material wealth, and why that kind in particular?

#### Readings

### Unions in Tech, March 10th, 2020

Guest speaker! Wes, a Campaign Lead with Communication Workers of America's Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE-CWA) will be coming to talk about CWA's initiative to support techonolgy and game workers organizing in their workplaces and to answer questions on unions and their role in technology workplaces.
